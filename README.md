# Influence of Solar Cycle Variability on Zonal Wind Dynamics

Objectives:

Determine if there are correlations between monthly mean sunspot numbers and mean zonal winds in the stratosphere from 1980s to present day. The goal would also be to determine if higher sunspot number correspond to stronger or weaker polar vortex winds in each hemisphere, while assessing lag relationships.

Datasets:

Solar Cycle/Sunspot Number – NOAA SWPC (Space Weather Conditions), Solar Influence Data Analysis Center’s Sunspot number 
Zonal Wind – ERA5 monthly mean zonal wind

Expected Findings:
I expect to find correlation between periods of high solar activity and stronger polar vortex winds in the stratosphere, with a lag between solar activity and atmospheric response. The strength of correlation might be influenced by season.
